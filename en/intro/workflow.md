# Upay API Workflow

## Step 1 - Apply

Please contact our customer representative for application: **Stanley Lu**

## Step 2 - Submit Application Materials

Please submit required materials as instructed for review. Once approved, you will get your `vendor_sn` and `vendor_key` for using Upay services.

Submit store information for activation codes to activate Upay terminals of the store.

Now, you are ready to use Upay services.

## Step 3 - Develop and Test Your Client Application

To help you develop your client application utilizing Upay services, we provide [Upay Web API](api/index.md), Upay SDK and Web Proxy (Documentation is not yet ready in English for Upay SDK and Web Proxy). <!--For a detailed explanation and comparison of the three, please refer to the [Integration Options](integration_options.md).-->

Once you choose a implementation plan, Upay will provide relevant technical support resources to guide you through the development phase.

Upay will also provide test cases to perform a system testing and supervise the whole process in order to confirm the testing quality.

## Step 4 - Release

To help you launch your client application as smoothly and efficiently as possible, Upay will also provide on-site support (Mainland China for now), hardware (like infrared scanners), and customized marketing materials upon request (additional fee may apply for hardware and materials).
