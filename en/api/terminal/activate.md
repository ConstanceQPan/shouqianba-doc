# Activate

The purpose of activation is to register the terminal device information and to get `terminal_sn` and `terminal_key` to sign the terminal's transaction requests. Any request without a signature will be deemed invalid by Upay Web API.

Similarly, `vendor_sn` and `vendor_key` should be used to sign activation requests. Please refer to [API Guide](../api_guide.md) on how to sign your requests.

**Note:** Each terminal needs to be activated once and only once.

## About Activation Code

Activation code is needed every time you try to activate a Upay terminal. There are several things to consider when you use your activation codes:

- Each activation code belongs to a store. Say activation code (A1) belongs to store (S1), the terminal device activated by A1 will thus belong to S1.
- Activation code has two usage limits: **number of usage** and **expiration date**. In most cases, the number of usage of an activation code is 1. So you will get a activation code for each of your terminal device. [TODO expiration date default value unknown]
- If an activation code has a number of usage larger than 1. You can use it to activate multiple devices. Each activation request with this activation code will give you a new terminal identity (a new set of `terminal_sn` and `terminal_key`).
